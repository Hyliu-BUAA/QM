# 动量算符 (Momentum operator)

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1. Introduction Part I
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. In quantum mechanics, the `momentum operator` is the operator associated with `linear momentum`. 
2. The `momentum operator` is, in the position representation, an example of `differential operator`. 
3. For the case of `one particle in one spatial dimension`, the definition is:
$$\begin{aligned}
\^{p} = -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}$$
    - $\hbar$ is `Planck's reduced constant`
    - `i` is `imaginary unit`
    - `x` is `spatial coordinate`
    - <font color="red" size="4">Note: Wavefuntion $\psi(x, t)$ is also function of `t`</font>
4. The application of `momentum operator` operate on a `differentiable wave function` is as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
\^{p}\psi = -i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}$$

</font>

<font color="red" size="4">

Note
----
1. The definition above is the `canonical momentum`:
   1. which is not `gauge invariant`
   2. not `a measurable physical quantity` for `charged particles in an electromagnetic field`.
   3. In that case, the `canonical momentum` is `not` equal to the `kinetic momentum`.

# 2. Origin from `De Broglie plane waves`

<font color="73DB90" size="5">

1. The `momentum operator` and `energy operator` can be constructed in the following way.

</font>

## 2.1. One dimension
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. Starting in `one dimension`, using the `plane wave solution` to `Schrodinger's equation` of `a single free particle`,
$$\psi(x,t) = e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(px-Et)}$$
    - $p$ is interpreted as `momentum` in the x-direction 
    - $E$ is the `particle energy`.
2. The `first order partial derivative` with respect to space is 
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial x} = \frac{ip}{\hbar}e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(px-Et)} = \frac{ip}{\hbar}\psi(x,t)
\end{aligned}$$
3. This suggests the operator equivalence
$$\begin{aligned}
\^{p} = -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}$$
so the `momentum of the particle` and the value that is measured when a `particle is in a plane wave state` is the `eigenstate` of the above state.

</font>


<font color="red" size="4">

Note
----
1. Since the `partial derivative` is a `linear operator`, the `momentum operator` is also `linear`
2. Any wave function can be expressed as a `superposition of other states`, when this `momentum operator` acts on the entire superimposed wave, it yields the momentum eigenvalues for each plane wave component. 
3. These new components then superimpose to form the new state, in general not a multiple of the old wave function.

</font>


## 2.2. Three dimensions
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. The derivation in three dimensions is same, except the `gradient operator del` is used instead of `one partial derivative`. In three dimensions, the `plane wave solution` to Schrodinger equation is:
$$\psi = e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(\vec{p}\vec{r}-Et)}$$
2. And the gradient is 
$$\begin{aligned}
\nabla \psi &= \vec{e_x}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \vec{e_y}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} + \vec{e_z}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} \\
&= \frac{i}{\hbar}(p_x\vec{e_x} + p_y\vec{e_y}+ p_z\vec{e_z})\psi   \\
&= \frac{i}{\hbar}\vec{p}\psi
\end{aligned}$$
$e_x$, $e_y$, and $e_z$ are the unit vectors for the `three spatial dimensions`
3. So, 
$$\^{p} = -i\hbar\nabla$$

</font>

<font color="red" size="4">

Note
----
1. This momentum operator is `in position space` because the `partial derivatives were taken with respect to the spatial variables`.
