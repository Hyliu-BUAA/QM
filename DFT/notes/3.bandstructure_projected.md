# 1. Does one electronic state stands for one elctrons?
<font color="stelblue" size="4">

1. In a non-degenerate system, each electronic state corresponds to one electron. This is because each electronic state can accomodate one electronic with a specific spin and energy.
2. However, in a degenerate system, multiple electronic states may have the same energy, and therefore can accommodate multiple electrons with the same energy and spin. 
3. In this case, the number of electronic states that can accommodate a give number of electrons is determined by Pauli exclusion principle, which can states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state with the same spin.
4. For example, consider a simple two-electron system, such as the hydrogen molecule. Each hydrogen atom has one electron at its ground state, which is 1s orbital with energy -13.6 eV. When two hydrogen atoms combine to form a molecule, their 1s orbital hybridize to form two new molecular orbitals: one bonding orbital, one anti-bonding orbital. Each orbital can accommodate two electrons with opposite spin.
5. If we assume that the two hydrogen atoms are far apart and don't interact, then each hydrogen atom has one electrons at ground state, and the total energy is 27.2 eV. However, when the two atoms combine to form new molecular orbitals, the bonding orbital becomes filled with two electrons, while the antibonding orbital remains empty. This results in a lower total energy of -31.5 eV, indicating that the molecule is more stable than the isolated atoms.

# 2. What is `spatial distribution of electronic state`?
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. The `spatial distribution` of an electronic state refers to the probability distribution of finding an electron in particular region of space.

# 3. Can you give me an exmaple of `states` with numpy, and introduce each dimension in details?
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. Suppose we have a simple system with `2 k-points`, `3 energy bands`, and `4 electronic states per band`. 
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a random array of complex numbers to represent the states
states = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4) + 1j * np.random.rand(2, 3, 4)
```
2. The states array has a shape of `(2, 3, 4)`, which means that it has 3 dimensions. Here's what each dimension represents:
    1. The first dimension represents the `k-points`. In this example, we have 2 k-points, so this dimension has a length of 2.
    2. The second dimension represents the `energy bands`. In this example, we have 3 energy bands, so this dimension has a length of 3.
    3. The third dimension represents the individual electronic states within each band. In this example, we have 4 electronic states per band, so this dimension has a length of 4.

# 4. In my opinion, electron state is represented by wavefunction, but in above code, it is just a complex number. What happen to it?
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. You are correct that electronic state is typically described by a wavefunction in quantum mechanics. 
2. In the context of code i provided, <font color="red">the `states` array represents the electronic states in a particular `basis set`, where `each state is represented by a set of complex numbers` rather than a wavefunction.</font>
3. The electronic state ar typically obtained by solving the Schrodinger equation for a particular system, subject to some boundary conditions. `The solution to Schrodinger equation are wavefunctions,` which describes the probability density of finding an electron `in particular state at a particular point in space`.
4. In practice, it is more computationally efficient to work with a set of `expansion coefficients` that describe the wavefunction in terms of `a basis sets of functions`. <font color="coral">In this case, each electronic state is represented by a set of `complex number` that `describe the amplitude of the state in each basis function`.</font>
5. In the code I provided, the `states` array gives the `expansion coeffifients` for each electronic states in the basis set, <font color="coral">with each element of the array representing the `amplitude of the state` in a particular `basis function`. </font>
6. The magnitude squared of each element gives the probability density of finding an electron in that state at a particular point in space.

# 5. If I have `coefficients of the plane wave expansion` for each band and each k-point, what can i get just from it? show me code with numpy, thanks.
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

In this code, we first load the expansion coefficients from the WAVECAR file using numpy's loadtxt function. We then extract the number of bands, k-points, and plane waves from the shape of the coeffs array.

Next, we reshape the coeffs array to separate the bands and k-points, and then calculate the norm of the coefficients for each plane wave. The norm of the coefficients is proportional to the electronic density of states.

Finally, we sum over the k-points and bands to obtain the DOS and save it to a file using numpy's savetxt function.

Note that this code does not include any smearing or other corrections to the DOS, so the result will be a raw DOS. To obtain a more accurate DOS, you may need to perform smearing or other post-processing steps.

```python
import numpy as np

# Load the expansion coefficients from the WAVECAR file
coeffs = np.loadtxt('WAVECAR', skiprows=8)

# Extract the number of bands, k-points, and plane waves
nbands = 4  # Replace with the number of bands
nkpts = 6   # Replace with the number of k-points
nplws = coeffs.shape[1] // (3 * nbands)

# Reshape the expansion coefficients to separate bands and k-points
coeffs = coeffs.reshape(nbands, nkpts, 3, nplws)

# Calculate the norm of the coefficients for each plane wave
norms = np.linalg.norm(coeffs, axis=2)

# Calculate the DOS by summing over k-points and bands
dos = np.sum(norms**2, axis=(0, 1))

# Save the DOS to a file
np.savetxt('DOS.dat', dos)
```


## 5.1. How to calculate the number of plane waves from WAVECAR?
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. In the VASP WAVECAR file, the number of plane waves used in expansion is given in the third line of the line.
    - The third line contains three numbers: `the number of bands`, `the number of kpoints`, `the number of plane waves used in expansion`

</font>

```python
import numpy as np

with open("WAVECAR", "f") as f:
    f.readline()
    f.readline()
    line = f.readline().decode().split()
    nplw = int(line[2])

print(f"Number of plane waves: {nplw}")
```

## 5.2. How to get the expansion coefficient of plane waves from WAVECAR?

1.

```python

```


## 5.3. Why `nplws = coeffs.shape[1] // (3 * nbands)`?
<font color="steelblue" size="4">

1. In the VASP WAVECAR file, the `expansion coefficients for each band and k-point` are stored as a flattened array of length `3 * nbands * nplws`
    - The `factor of 3` arises because the coefficients are stored in cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). Each cartesian component of each plane wave is represented by nplws real numbers, giving a total of `3 * nplws real numbers per band and k-point`.
